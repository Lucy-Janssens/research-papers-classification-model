# Neural Network-Based Research-Articles Classification

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the development and comparison of neural network models for the task of classifying academic papers. Utilizing a dataset of paper titles and abstracts, we explore the effectiveness of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models in multi-label classification tasks.

## Installation

To set up this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lucy-Janssens/research-papers-classification-model.git
cd research-papers-classification-model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Instructions on how to run the models:

```python
# Example command
python NeuralNetwork-Based_Research-Articles_Classification.py
```

## Data

The dataset includes titles and abstracts of academic papers categorized into several fields such as Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Statistics, Quantitative Biology, and Quantitative Finance

## Features

- Implementation of MLP and CNN for text classification.
- Comparative analysis of model performance.
- Detailed parameter tuning and optimization strategies.
